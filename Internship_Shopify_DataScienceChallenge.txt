AOV is calculated by taking the sum of revenue, which then is divided by the total amount of orders.
Even though these shops are selling relatively affordable sneakers, 
the AOV can be high when there are multiple orders that consists of thousands of sneakers 
(each of them can cheap but when there are thousands of them it adds up to the high order cost).
b)
We should use the metric "Average item value", i.e., taking the sum of revenue, which is then divided by
the total amount of items sales in all orders.
